Coda-clips for Hammer for Mac


Install
Download the clips file and import into Coda - View > Sidebar >Clips to see the clips in the sidebar and then down the bottom (usually) is the gear wheel options button - click that and chose import clips - find the downloaded file and import.


Usage
I usually either double click on the clip to get it added to where the cursor is in the code - you can drag and drop. I have added insertion points ionto some of the clips to show you where to add the variable for that clip.

Enjoy!
